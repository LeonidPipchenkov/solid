# SOLID

## SOLID Principles

➡️ Single Responsibility\
Each class should have only one purpose and not be filled with excessive functionality.

➡️ Open Closed\
Classes should be open for extension and closed for modification.
In other words, you should not rewrite an existing class for implementing new features.

➡️ Liskov Substitution\
Every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for its base or parent class.

➡️ Interface Segregation\
Interfaces should not force classes to implement what they cannot do.
Large interfaces should be divided into small ones.

➡️ Dependency Inversion\
Components should depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.
